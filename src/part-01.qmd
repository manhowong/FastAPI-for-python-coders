# The Web as Remote Function Calls

If you’ve ever written a Python script that calls a function, processes data, and prints results, you already know more than you think. Building a web API is essentially the same workflow, except the function call travels over the internet to reach someone else’s computer (or your own, running as a server simultaneously).

We’ll anchor this journey by building toward a practical LLM-powered chat application—something that actually streams responses from an AI like a real product. But every skill you learn here applies equally to building inventory systems, data dashboards, or mobile app backends.

Let’s start by rewiring how you think about calling functions.

## What If You Could Call a Function on Someone Else’s Computer?

Picture yourself at your desk, running Python in a notebook or script. When you write:

```python
user = get_user(user_id=123)
```

Python jumps straight into `get_user`, grabs the data, and hands it back to you instantly. Everything happens in one place: your computer.

Now imagine you want your friend’s computer (or a server in the cloud) to run that `get_user` lookup for you. You can’t just type the function name and expect their machine to hear you. You need a agreed-upon protocol for asking, and a format for the answer.

That protocol is **HTTP**, and that request-and-answer dance is the heartbeat of every FastAPI application.

Think of it like this: instead of calling a function directly, you’re sending a polite letter asking another computer to run a function for you. That letter includes:
- **The address** (the URL, like `/users/123`)
- **The action** (GET me the data, or POST this new data)
- **Any arguments** (packed neatly as JSON, the internet’s version of a Python dictionary)

When the other computer finishes, it sends a letter back containing your result—or a note explaining why it couldn’t help (we’ll call that note a **status code**).

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme': 'handDrawn'}}%%

    participant C as Your Script (Client)
    participant S as FastAPI Server
    C->>S: HTTP Request: GET /users/123
    Note over S: Server runs get_user(123)
    S->>C: HTTP Response: {"name": "Alice"}
```

## The HTTP Vocab

**GET** and **POST** are the two actions you’ll use most. Think of GET as *reading* or *fetching*—like opening a file or querying a dictionary. Use GET when you want data but aren’t changing anything on the server. POST is for *actions* or *creating* things—like appending to a list, processing a payment, or later on, sending a prompt to an LLM. If GET is "fetch the menu," POST is "place the order."

**Status codes** are the server’s way of communicating what happened. You can map them directly to Python experiences you already have:
- **200** means "Success!" (like a function returning normally)
- **404** means "Not Found" (like a `KeyError` when you look up a missing dictionary key)
- **422** means "You sent me bad data" (like a `ValueError` when you pass a string to an integer parameter)

**JSON** is simply the wire format that lets Python dictionaries travel between computers. When you `return {"message": "hello"}` from FastAPI, it automatically becomes JSON bytes over the wire, and the client’s Python code receives it as `{"message": "hello"}` again. No manual translation required.

## FastAPI App in 5 Minutes

We’ll create the smallest possible web application—just enough to see that "remote function call" in action.

### Setting Up

You’ll need two Python packages: `fastapi` for the framework, and `uvicorn` for the server engine that actually listens for network letters and hands them to your code. Think of Uvicorn as the friendly receptionist who answers the phone and routes calls to your FastAPI app.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

Create a file named `main.py` and add exactly this:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

# This creates your app instance—think of it as the switchboard
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, web world!"}
```

That `@app.get("/")` line is doing something powerful: it’s mapping the URL address `/` to your Python function `read_root`. When someone (a browser, a script, or later your React frontend) sends a GET request to that address, FastAPI runs your function and ships back the dictionary as JSON.

### Running the Development Server

Now for the magic moment. In your terminal, run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The `--reload` flag means "watch my code and restart if I make changes"—perfect for learning.

You should see a message telling you the server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Open your browser and visit that address, or use curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

You’ll receive `{"message":"Hello, web world!"}`. Congratulations—you just made a remote function call! Your browser sent an HTTP GET request to `/`, FastAPI executed `read_root()`, and the return value flew back as JSON.

### Interactive Documentation

Here’s where FastAPI spoils you. While your server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser. You’ll see a beautiful, interactive dashboard called **Swagger UI**. 

This page is auto-generated from your Python code. It lists every endpoint you’ve defined (right now, just our root path), shows exactly what JSON structure it expects and returns, and even lets you click "Try it out" to fire test requests without leaving the browser. 

This isn’t just documentation—it’s a contract. Because you used Python type hints (even implicitly, by returning a dict), FastAPI generated a schema that frontend developers can rely on. No extra work required.

## Hands-On: Make the Web Server Talk Back

Let’s cement this with two tiny endpoints you’ll actually use in real projects—especially that LLM app we’re building toward.

First, a **health check**. Every production service needs a simple "are you awake?" endpoint that monitoring tools can ping. Add this to your `main.py`:

```python
@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Save the file (Uvicorn will reload automatically), then visit `http://localhost:8000/health`. You should see your status dictionary.

Second, an **echo endpoint** that accepts data. This teaches you POST and proves that data flows both ways. Add this below your health check:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Message(BaseModel):
    text: str
    sender: str

@app.post("/echo")
def echo_message(message: Message):
    return {
        "received": message.text,
        "from": message.sender,
        "response": f"Echo: {message.text}"
    }
```

Notice `BaseModel`? It’s just a way to declare "this endpoint expects JSON with a `text` string and a `sender` string." FastAPI will automatically validate the incoming JSON—if someone sends malformed data, they’ll get a helpful 422 error (remember that "bad data" code?) before your function even runs.

Test it in your Swagger UI at `/docs`:
1. Click the `/echo` endpoint, then "Try it out"
2. Paste this JSON into the request body:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "Hello from the internet",
     "sender": "Student"
   }
   ```
3. Click Execute

You should see your echoed response. You’ve just built an API that accepts structured input and returns structured output—the exact pattern we’ll use later to send prompts to an LLM.

## Recap: Terms You Learned

Before we move on to building endpoints with real parameters, let’s consolidate the vocabulary you’ve earned. Here’s how web concepts map to your Python intuition:

| Web Term | What it actually means in Python |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Endpoint** | The specific URL address that triggers your function—like a named entry point for remote calls |
| **Request** | The "letter" sent by the client containing the HTTP method, headers, and JSON body (arguments) |
| **Response** | The dictionary (or data) your function returns, wrapped with a status code (the exit code of the operation) |
| **GET** | The "read-only" method for fetching data—safe, like accessing a dictionary key |
| **POST** | The "action" method for sending data to be processed—like calling a function that appends to a list |
| **JSON** | The wire format that lets Python dictionaries travel between computers; think of it as `pickle` but human-readable and universal |
| **Status Code** | The numeric result of the operation: 200 for success, 404 for "not found," 422 for "bad arguments" |

In the next section, we’ll expand this foundation. You’ll learn to capture pieces of the URL as function arguments (path parameters), accept query strings (like keyword arguments), and use Pydantic to enforce data contracts—skills that will let us wire up that LLM chat interface with clean, reliable code.
